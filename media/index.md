# Media (Images and Files)

By default, images, background images and document files can be added to your site.

You can either add them directly to your site by going to Content > Media (/admin/content/media), or as you create content through fields and [WYSIWYG](../wysiwyg/index.md) text editors.

When adding an image or document, give the file a name. This is helpful when searching and selecting media items later on. This can be the same as the filename, but is independent.

Next, select a file from you computer. Below each upload field there is help text points out any restrictions regarding file size, type.

## Images

**Pro Tip**: For images, try to upload high-resolution, small file size images. This will ensure fast loading and great viewing experiences.

After upload, more settings will appear.

### Alternative Text

It is important to provide alternative text for images to aid visually-impaired users.

### Image Thumbnail

A rendered thumbnail of your uploaded image should appear. There are areas of the site that will use this image and crop it to fit the space. Click on the focus area of the image. This helps to make sure that someone's head isn't chopped off during cropping.

There will also be a preview link under the thumbnail image with different image styles used on the site to make sure the focus you selected will work for the image.

# Media (Remote Videos)

By default, remote videos can be added to your site.

You can either add them directly to your site by going to Content > Media (/admin/content/media), or as you create content through fields and [WYSIWYG](../wysiwyg/index.md) text editors.

# Using Existing Media

For media file fields and the [WYSIWYG](../wysiwyg/index.md) text areas (link for documents, entity media embed for images), you will be able to search for and select a media file.
