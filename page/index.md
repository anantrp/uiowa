# Basic Pages

Basic pages are quite versatile and will most likely make up most of the content on your site.

## Page Title

Every page needs a title. This is a required field. Other required fields are marked with a red asterisk.

## Advanced Page Configuration

There are a lot of optional advanced settings.

### Revision Information

You can view the date and time of the last saved revision.

Additionally, type a revision log message indicating what changes you have made to the page.

When the page is saved, the revision log will be saved including the typed message, date and time of revision, and author for future reference.

### Content Description

Type a short summary of you content here. It will be used if there are any displays around the site that reference this content. By default, this is also used by search engines when they crawl and index your site.

When the page is saved the content description will be saved for future reference.

### Relationships

You can create relationships to taxonomy terms (References) and other content (Related Content) that already exist on the site.

#### Related Content

Link this content to one or more existing pieces of content within this site. Related content will display as a linked menu to that content. Most commonly, this is helpful to link to other content on the site that might live elsewhere in the menu system.

#### References

For References, comma-separate your references.
