# User Management and Roles

When you login to your site, you will be assigned a role. The default roles are editor, publisher, and
webmaster. Editors are mostly responsible for content management. Publishers and Webmasters
have elevated permissions to handle more administrative tasks, like managing
users.

To see an overview of the people with access to the site, go to People (/admin/people).

## Adding Users

*Note:* Webmaster role required.

From the people overview page click the Add User action button (/admin/people/create).

From here, enter the HawkID of the person you would like to add to the site. You can find a HawkID for an individual using the [UIowa Directory](https://iam.uiowa.edu/whitepages/search).

Set their status to active (default), and select the role(s) you would like the user to have. Click Save.

## Managing Existing Users

*Note:* Webmaster role required.

From the people overview page you can edit one or more existing users at a time. You can block/grant their access to the site, add/remove roles or cancel their account.

When canceling an account, options will be presented about how to handle site content that user may have created. The option you select may have unintended consequences. When in doubt, but you need to keep the user from logging into your site, just change their status to blocked.
