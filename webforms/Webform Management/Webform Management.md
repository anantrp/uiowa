"The overall sensitivity of institutional data encompasses not only its confidentiality, but also its integrity and availability.  Many confidentiality obligations exist, such as those required for personal information and to meet contractual or regulatory requirements.  Integrity, or trustworthiness, of institutional data must also be considered and aligned with institutional risk; that is, the impact on the institution should the data not be accurate.  Availability relates to the impact on the institutionâ€™s ability to function if the institutional data is not reliably accessible to authorized users."
