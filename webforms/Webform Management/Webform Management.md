# (NOT OFFICIAL) Webform Management and Best Practices (Work in Progress)
Document how to manage webforms, including best practices on the types of information (protected data) which should not be collected.

NOTE: write in. Contact IT Security Office for more information regarding precautions, policy and security of data.

It is crucial to properly handle collected data from webforms. The following information explains the best practices on the type of information (protected data) that should not be collected.
## Protected Data
Generally a webform should only ask for and collect information labeled by the University as "Public". Public data is classified as "data that is public, or published with no restrictions. Examples include published "white pages" directory information, maps, academic course descriptions, news releases."

## Information Security
"The overall sensitivity of institutional data encompasses not only its confidentiality, but also its integrity and availability.  Many confidentiality obligations exist, such as those required for personal information and to meet contractual or regulatory requirements.  Integrity, or trustworthiness, of institutional data must also be considered and aligned with institutional risk; that is, the impact on the institution should the data not be accurate.  Availability relates to the impact on the institutionâ€™s ability to function if the institutional data is not reliably accessible to authorized users."
