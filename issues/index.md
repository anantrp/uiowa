# Known Issues

- There are issues with embedding content within the [WYSIWYG text editor](../wysiwyg/index.md) with certain versions of Chrome. We recommend using another browser if you encounter any of the following:
  - After embedding a file into the content area, you can't type or advance the cursor from the file focus.
  - Tabbing or arrow keys also do not work.
  - Pasting text into the editor, pastes over the embedded file link.
  - The embed media window doesn't close after reopening.
