## 'WWW' Addresses

The SiteNow service is set up to redirect www requests to the bare domain equivalent. Redirecting from a bare domain to the www equivalent is not supported.


## Removal of Inactive Sites

Periodically, ITS will audit SiteNow websites for activity. Websites that have not been logged in to for at least 6 months will be considered inactive.

When a website has been determined to be inactive, ITS will attempt to contact the site webmasters via their University of Iowa email addresses to verify if the website is still needed. If ITS does not receive a response within 1 week, a follow-up email will be sent. If a response to the follow-up email is not received within 1 week, the website is subject to removal without further notice.

Once a website is removed due to inactivity, a copy of the site content cannot be restored.

## Domain Changes

Each request to change a website's domain will be reviewed on case-by-case basis. Complications can arise with absolute URLs within the site content. Changing a website's domain is a multi-step process and will be billed to the site owner. In some cases, it may be more cost effective for the site owner to request a replacement website and move content manually. As the existing site might be linked to from other sites, the site owner is responsible for advertising the change to campus and others.

## Platform Updates

Occasionally there will be platform updates where new features, theme changes, security updates or general functionality will be updated. During this time, it is possible for some website downtime or loss of functionality. For certain updates, a customer review or test process will be scheduled ahead of the rollout to ensure any changes to the platform will work as intended.

## Accessibility/Security

SiteNow strives to create a WCAG 2.0 compliant and secure websites. We reserve the right to deny requests from site owners that we believe will not meet those standards (e.g. JavaScript embeds, poor color contrast combinations). and that we will deny feature requests that we believe won't meet those standards (e.g. JavaScript embeds, inaccessible font colors).

If we are notified that a site has been flagged as inaccessible or vulnerable to attack, we will take steps to remedy the issue. If an immediate remediation cannot be performed to resolve the issue, we reserve the right to suspend or permanently remove the website.

## Videos

SiteNow sites don't allow video uploads directly to the site. The SiteNow service is no equipped to handle the storage and playback of large video files. Instead, we encourage the use of third-party services such as YouTube and Vimeo which can be embedded into WYSIWYG text areas.

To maintain the accessibility of videos, captions should be added and/or transcripts should be made available near the video.
