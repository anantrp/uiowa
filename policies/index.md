# Policies


## 'WWW' Addresses

Starting with the Drupal 8 service, 'WWW' sites will not be supported and all 'WWW' requests will redirect to the non-WWW equivalent.


## Removal of inactive sites

Periodically, ITS will audit SiteNow websites for activity. Websites that have not been logged in to for at least 6 months will be considered inactive.

When a website has been determined to be inactive, ITS will attempt to contact the designated site owners via their University of Iowa email addresses to verify if the website is still needed. If ITS does not receive a response within 1 week, a follow-up email will be sent. If a response to the follow-up email is not received within 1 week, the website is subject to removal without further notice.

Once a website is removed due to inactivity, a copy of the site content cannot be restored.


## Platform Updates

Occassionally there will be platform updates where new features, theme changes, security updates or general functionality will be updated. During this time it is possible for some website downtime or loss of functionality. For certain updates, a customer review or test process will be scheduled ahead of the rollout to ensure any changes to the platform will work as intended.

## Videos

SiteNow sites don't allow video uploads directly to the site. The SiteNow service is no equipped to handle the storage and playback of large video files. Instead, we encourage the use of third-party services such as YouTube and Vimeo which can be embedded into WYSIWYG text areas.

To maintain the accessibility of videos, captions should be added and/or transcripts should be made available near the video.
