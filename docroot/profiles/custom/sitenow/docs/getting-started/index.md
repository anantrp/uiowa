# Getting Started

A lot of documentation exists in your site in various places. The first step is
to login.

## Logging In
Open your web browser and enter the URL of your site. Add `/user` to the end of
the URL to go to the login page. For example, `https://mysite.uiowa.edu/user`.
Once there, click the `HawkID Login` link. This will redirect you to the single-
sign-on page for HawkID authentication. Enter your credentials and you will be
redirected back to your site.

## Roles
Once logged in, you will be assigned a role. The default roles are editor and
webmaster. Editors are mostly responsible for content management. Webmasters
have elevated permissions to handle more administrative tasks, like managing
users.

## Toolbar
The administrative toolbar gives you quick access to the most important
administrative pages. You will see different toolbar items based on your role.
