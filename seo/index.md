# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

"Out of the box," your site is pretty well optimized for Search Engines to crawl and index your site.

You can fine-tune global metatag defaults by going to Configuration > Metatag (/admin/config/search/metatag)

You can override the defaults for each instance under the Advanced tab of the edit page for that content.

By default on the basic page content type, the "Content Description" field is used for the meta description value.

## Sitemap (Work in Progress)

Each site automatically generates a sitemap which can be found at /sitemap.xml

When creating a site it is recommended to take the sitemap and create a Google search console property. Similar to how it was done with Drupal 7 sites.

## Notifying Search Engines

To kick-start the Google crawling/indexing process you can setup at [Google Webmasters](https://www.google.com/webmasters) and submit your sitemap and/or [submit your URL](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url?pli=1)

~~For Bing, you can [submit your URL](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/submit-site-url).~~

Bing has recently retired their URL submit tool and now has a similar service to Google's for webmasters. [You can sign-up for Bing's Webmasters service here](https://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster/).
