# Content Moderation and Workflow

There are several states available for content, and these states control whether or not content will be visible to the public. These states include Draft, Review, Published, and Archive.

These states are primarily used when creating new content for your site, or when content is outdated, but may be used again in the future. The workflow is used for Articles, Basic Pages, and People.

## Workflow States

### Draft - Not publicly visible
New content is created in the Draft stage. All Editors, Webmasters, and Publishers may create content for this state.
### Review - Not publicly visible
Content can be moved from Draft by the Editor, Publisher, and Webmaster roles. This content should be considered completed, and in need of proofing/editing prior to final publication.
### Published - Publicly visible
Publishers and Webmasters, after reviewing content, may move it from Review to Published. While the content may still be altered, at this point the content will be visible to the public. (Note: Webmasters and Editors may move content directly from Draft to Published.)
### Archived - Not publicly visible
Published content which is out-of-date or otherwise not to be currently available for public viewing may be Archived by a Publisher or Webmaster. 

Content which has been Archived may be accessed by Publishers, Webmasters, and the Editor who created the content, but it will not be visible to anyone else. Publishers and Webmasters may restore an Archived piece of content to Published, where it will again be publicly visible.

## User Roles

While Webmasters have additional permissions above Publishers, both roles have the same permissions in terms of Content Moderation.
