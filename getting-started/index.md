# Getting Started

A lot of documentation exists in your site in various places. The first step is
to login.

## Logging In

There are two ways to login to a site.

### Method 1:

Open your web browser and enter the URL of your site. Add `/saml/login` to the end of the URL to go to the login page. For example, `https://mysite.uiowa.edu/user`. 

### Method 2:

Click the login link in the footer of the site.

##

Once there, click the `HawkID Login` link. This will redirect you to the single-
sign-on page for HawkID authentication. Enter your credentials and you will be
redirected back to your site.

## Roles

Once logged in, you will be assigned a role. The default roles are editor, publisher and
webmaster. Editors are mostly responsible for content management. Publishers and Webmasters have elevated permissions to handle more administrative tasks, like managing
users.

To learn more about user roles, read *https://docs.sitenow.uiowa.edu/content-moderation/*.

## Toolbar

The administrative toolbar gives you quick access to the most important
administrative pages. You will see different toolbar items based on your role.
